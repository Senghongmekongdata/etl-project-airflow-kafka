## Scenario
You are a data engineer at a data analytics consulting company. You have been assigned to a project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. As a vehicle passes a toll plaza, the vehicle's data like `vehicle_id,vehicle_type,toll_plaza_id` and `timestamp` are streamed to Kafka. Your job is to create a data pipe line that collects the streaming data and loads it into a database.


## Objectives
In this assignment you will create a streaming data pipe by performing these steps:

- Start a MySQL Database server.
- Create a table to hold the toll data.
- Start the Kafka server.
- Install the Kafka python driver.
- Install the MySQL python driver.
- Create a topic named toll in kafka.
- Download streaming data generator program.
- Customize the generator program to steam to toll topic.
- Download and customise streaming data consumer.
- Customize the consumer program to write into a MySQL database table.
- Verify that streamed data is being collected in the database table.

> Note:  Make sure you are samilar with bash shell and some basic knownledge on kafka and running on ubuntu or linux machine and have mysql running in this machine as well as python.

## Prepare the lab environment
- Step 1: Download Kafka
```
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.8.0/kafka_2.12-2.8.0.tgz
```
- Step 2: Extract Kafka 
```
tar -xzf kafka_2.12-2.8.0.tgz
```
- Step 3: Start MySQL server.
> If you are running on wsl ubuntu machine check this doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database
```
start_mysql
```
- Step 4: Connect to the mysql server, using the command below. Make sure you use the password given to you when the MySQL server starts. Please make a note or record of the password because you will need it later.
```
mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root --password=Mjk0NDQtcnNhbm5h
```
- Step 5: Create a database named `tolldata`
> At the 'mysql>' prompt, run the command below to create the database.
```
create database tolldata;
```
- Step 6: Create a table named livetolldata with the schema to store the data generated by the traffic simulator.
> Run the following command to create the table:
```
use tolldata;

create table livetolldata(timestamp datetime,vehicle_id int,vehicle_type char(15),toll_plaza_id smallint);
```
This is the table where you would store all the streamed data that comes from kafka. Each row is a record of when a vehicle has passed through a certain toll plaza along with its type and anonymized id.

- Step 7: Disconnect from MySQL server.
```
exit
```
- Step 8: Install the python module kafka-python using the pip3 command.
```
pip3 install kafka-python
```
This python module will help you to communicate with kafka server. It can used to send and receive messages from kafka.

- Step 8: Install the python module mysql-connector-python using the pip3 command.
```
pip3 install mysql-connector-python 
```
This python module will help you to interact with mysql server.

## Start Kafka
### Task 2.1 - Start Zookeeper
Start zookeeper server.

Take a screenshot of the command you run.

### Task 2.2 - Start Kafka server
Start Kafka server

### Task 2.3 - Create a topic named toll
Create a Kakfa topic named `toll`


### Task 2.4 - Download the Toll Traffic Simulator
Download the `toll_traffic_generator.py` from the url given below using 'wget'.

`https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Final%20Assignment/toll_traffic_generator.py`

Open the code using the theia editor using the "Menu --> File -->Open" option.

### Task 2.5 - Configure the Toll Traffic Simulator
Open the `toll_traffic_generator.py` and set the topic to toll.

### Task 2.6 - Run the Toll Traffic Simulator
Run the `toll_traffic_generator.py`.

Hint : python3 <pythonfilename> runs a python program on the theia lab.

### Task 2.7 - Configure streaming_data_reader.py
Download the `streaming_data_reader.py` from the url below using 'wget'.

`
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0250EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Final%20Assignment/streaming_data_reader.py`

Open the streaming_data_reader.py and modify the following details so that the program can connect to your mysql server.

**TOPIC**

**DATABASE**

**USERNAME**

**PASSWORD**

### Task 2.8 - Run streaming_data_reader.py
Run the `streaming_data_reader.py`
```
python3 streaming_data_reader.py
```

### Task 2.9 - Health check of the streaming data pipeline.
If you have done all the steps till here correctly, the streaming toll data would get stored in the table livetolldata.

List the top 10 rows in the table livetolldata to see whether you get the right data or not.
